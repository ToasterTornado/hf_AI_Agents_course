# My First AI Agent

This repository contains a basic AI agent that I built in **Unit 1** of the *AI Agents* course by Hugging Face. The course teaches foundational concepts in AI agents, including how agents make decisions, how they use large language models (LLMs) as reasoning engines, and how they interact with external tools.:contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0}

In this unit, I learned how to:

- Understand what an AI agent is and how it works
- Use the `smolagents` framework to construct a simple agent
- Integrate tools that help the agent take actions
- Deploy and test the agent locally

This project includes the agent implementation, example tools, and all required configuration files.
