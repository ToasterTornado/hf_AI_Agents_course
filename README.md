# 🧠 Hugging Face AI Agents Course — Learning Journey

Welcome to my learning journey through the **Hugging Face 🤗 AI Agents Course**!  
This repository contains the notebooks, experiments, notes, and insights I created while completing the course.

The course teaches how to build intelligent AI agents using Python and modern AI frameworks — with a focus on practical projects and real agent workflows.

## 📚 Course Overview

This repository corresponds to the units and topics covered in the official **Hugging Face Agents Course**, including:

- Introduction to AI agents
- Building agents with frameworks like **smolagents**, **LlamaIndex**, and **LangGraph**
- Creating retrieval‑augmented workflows
- Debugging, testing, and enhancing agent behavior

The official course is available here:

## 🧪 What I Learned

### 🧠 Agent Fundamentals
- What agents are and how they function  
- The **thought‑action‑observation loop** in intelligent systems  
- How Large Language Models power reasoning in agents

### 🛠 Agent Frameworks
- **smolagents** — small, extensible Python agents  
- **LlamaIndex** — Vector stores, RAG, and retrieval‑powered agents  
- **LangGraph** — Structured agent plans and workflows

### 📝 Practical Projects
- Built custom tools and integrated them into agent workflows
- Experimented with retrieval and reasoning in real tasks
- Debugged model behavior and tool usage

➡ These insights are in the notebooks and code examples I committed.
